    Listen. There
    are pieces of dynamite all around the hospital. I need you to find them. Once
    you get them, I''ll tell ya where you can find some of the special chemicals
    in the hospital. The plan-listen close, you idiot-the plan is make a potion that
    would attract the beast to a certain room, and then set off the dynamite in that
    room. This will explode the creature.'
