  DialogueLine: The Infirmary shoud be close by. Get me bandages as soon as possible.
    I heard the Infirmary being completely destroyed by that wretched beast outside
    so you might have to get down on the ground and search on the floor for some
    bandages. But you'd better hurry. You're gonna bleed out soon if you don't leave.
