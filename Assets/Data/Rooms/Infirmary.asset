  StartingRoomDescription: This room feels quiet. I can feel some packages along
    my feet...hmm...some of these packages seem rummaged through...almost messed
    up....wait...I think I'm in the infirmary!!! I should look for bandages.
  RoomDescription: The infirmary again...I kinda wish that monster didn't make a
    mess everywhere...the floor's filled with packages now.
