  StartingRoomDescription: 'The air suddenly felt different as I pushed through.
    I could feel the humidity of the air on my exposed flesh. From the echo of my
    footsteps, this room seems to be of medium size. I definitely have been in larger
    rooms. I''ll call this room Main Hall...


    I guess I just gotta feel my way
    around it. I''ll definitely know I''m doing something wrong if I bump into a
    wall. '
  RoomDescription: I'm in the Main Hall now.
