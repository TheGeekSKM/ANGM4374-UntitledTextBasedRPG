  StartingRoomDescription: This room feels a lot smaller. I can sense the walls near
    me. I need to avoid bumping into any of the walls, but the small amount of sound
    keeps bouncing off the walls. I can feel some shelves...maybe some items in here...I'll
    call this room the Storage Room. I should feel around...
  RoomDescription: Ah. I'm in the Storage Room now.
